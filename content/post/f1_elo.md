## Context

I'm a big armchair fan of F1. I've played 100+ hours of the F1 games and there's nothing I like more on a race day than turning on the TV, muting the F1 commentary until the theme tune kicks in and feeling the wave of anxiety rush over me a few minutes before the start of a race that has no bearing on my personal life begins - bonafide legit fan.

I've also become more interested in chess. Queens Gambit kicked off an addiction to solving chess puzzles but refusing to actually play anyone - because who needs that reality check. 2 years of daily puzzles completed friend, of course I'm at a grandmaster level. 

This has all culminated in a recent party where someone brought up for the n-hundreth time the golden question:

> Who is the F1 greatest of all time (GOAT)?

There are many opinions. Is it Senna, Michael Schumacher, Hamilton or Michael Masi? Sorry, not sorry for that F1 joke. Well, given I have the hammer (data science and the chess/F1 thing) why don't I try and find out who it is.
